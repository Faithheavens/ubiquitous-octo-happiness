The word ''cosmetics'' derives from the [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] {{lang|el|κοσμητικὴ τέχνη}} ({{lang|el-Latn|"kosmetikē tekhnē"}}), meaning "technique of dress and ornament", from {{lang|el|κοσμητικός}} ({{lang|el-Latn|"kosmētikos"}}), "skilled in ordering or arranging"<ref>Liddell, Henry George and Scott, Robert.

=== Legal definition ===
{{Globalize section|date=August 2021}}
Though the legal definition of cosmetics in most countries is broader, in some Western countries, cosmetics are commonly taken to mean only makeup products, such as [[lipstick]], [[mascara]], [[eye shadow]], [[Foundation (cosmetics)|foundation]], [[blush (cosmetics)|blush]], [[Highlighter (cosmetics)|highlighter]], [[bronzer]], and several other product types.

In the United States, the [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA), which regulates cosmetics,<ref name="USHealthandHuman" /> defines cosmetics as products "intended to be applied to the human body for cleansing, beautifying, promoting attractiveness, or altering the appearance without affecting the body's structure or functions". This broad definition includes any material intended for use as an [[ingredient]] of a cosmetic product, with the FDA specifically excluding pure [[soap]] from this category.<ref>{{cite web|title=Cosmetics Overview|url=https://www.fda.gov/ForIndustry/ImportProgram/ImportBasics/RegulatedProducts/ucm511464.htm|access-date=30 March 2019|website=U.S. Food & Drug Administration|archive-date=30 March 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190330032557/https://www.fda.gov/ForIndustry/ImportProgram/ImportBasics/RegulatedProducts/ucm511464.htm|url-status=live}}</ref>

== Use ==
Cosmetics designed for [[skin care]] can be used to cleanse, exfoliate and protect the skin, as well as replenishing it, through the use of [[cleanser]]s, toners, serums, moisturizers, and balms. Cosmetics designed for more general [[personal care]], such as [[shampoo]] and [[body wash]], can be used to cleanse the body.

Cosmetics designed to enhance one's appearance (makeup) can be used to conceal blemishes, enhance one's natural features (such as the [[eyebrow]]s and [[eyelash]]es), add color to a person's face and—in the case of more extreme forms of makeup used for performances, fashion shows and people in costume—can be used to change the appearance of the face entirely to resemble a different person, creature or object. Techniques for changing appearance include [[contouring]], which aims to give shape to an area of the face.

Cosmetics can also be designed to add [[fragrance]] to the body.

== History ==
{{Main|History of cosmetics}}
Cosmetics have been in use for thousands of years, with ancient Egyptians and Sumerians using them. In Europe, use of cosmetics continued into the [[Middle Ages]]—where the face was whitened and the cheeks rouged—<ref name="auto1">Angeloglou, Maggie. ''The History of Make-up''. First ed. Great Britain: The Macmillan Company, 1970. 41–42. Print.</ref> though attitudes towards cosmetics varied throughout time, with the use of cosmetics being openly frowned upon at many points in Western history.<ref>{{cite book | title = Lipstick: A Celebration of the World's Favorite Cosmetic | first = J | last = Pallingston | isbn = 978-0-312-19914-2 | publisher = St. Martin's Press | year = 1998}}</ref> Regardless of the changes in social attitudes towards cosmetics, ideals of appearance were occasionally achieved through the use of cosmetics by many.

According to one source, early major developments in cosmetics include:<ref name=Ullmann />
* [[Kohl (cosmetics)|Kohl]] used by ancient Egyptians
* [[Castor oil]] also used in ancient Egypt as a protective [[Liniment|balm]]
* [[Cream (pharmaceutical)|Skin creams]] made of [[beeswax]], [[olive oil]], and [[rose water]], described by the Romans
* [[Vaseline]] and [[lanolin]] in the nineteenth century.

Historically, the absence of regulation of the manufacture and use of cosmetics, as well as the absence of scientific knowledge regarding the effects of various compounds on the human body for much of this time period, led to a number of negative [[adverse effect]]s upon those who used cosmetics, including [[deformities]], blindness and in some cases death.  Many cosmetic products available at this time were still either chemically dubious or derived from natural resources commonly found in the kitchen, such as food colouring, berries and [[beetroot]]. Examples of the prevalent usage of harmful cosmetics include the use of [[ceruse]] (white lead) throughout a number of different cultures, such as during the [[Renaissance]] in the West, and blindness caused by the mascara [[mascara#history|Lash Lure]] during the early 20th century. During the 19th century, there was a high number of incidences of lead [[poisoning]] due to the fashion for red and white lead makeup and powder, leading to swelling and inflammation of the eyes, weakened tooth enamel and blackening skin, with heavy use known to lead to death. Usage of white lead was not confined only to the West, with the white Japanese face makeup known as {{lang|ja-Latn|[[oshiroi]]}} also produced using white lead. In the second part of the 19th century, scientific advances in the production of makeup lead to the creation of makeup free of hazardous substances such as [[lead]].{{citation needed|date=October 2020}}

Throughout the later 19th century and early 20th century, changes in the prevailing attitudes towards cosmetics led to the wider expansion of the cosmetics industry, with the market developed in the US during the 1910s by figures such as [[Elizabeth Arden]], [[Helena Rubinstein]], and [[Max Factor]]. These firms were joined by [[Revlon]] just before [[World War II]] and [[Estée Lauder Companies|Estée Lauder]] just after. By the middle of the 20th century, cosmetics were in widespread use by women in nearly all [[industrial society|industrial societies]] around the world, with the cosmetics industry becoming a multibillion-dollar enterprise by the beginning of the 21st century.{{citation needed|reason=This statement needs a source that isn't encyclopedia.com.|date=October 2020}} The wider acceptance of the use of cosmetics led some to see makeup as a tool utilised in the oppression and subjection of women to unfair societal standards. In 1968 at the feminist [[Miss America protest]], protestors symbolically threw a number of feminine products into a "Freedom Trash Can",<ref>{{cite journal | author=Dow, Bonnie J. |title=Feminism, Miss America, and Media Mythology |journal=Rhetoric & Public Affairs |volume=6 |issue=1 |date= Spring 2003 |pages=127–149 |doi=10.1353/rap.2003.0028|s2cid=143094250 }}</ref> with cosmetics among the items the protestors called "instruments of female torture"<ref>{{cite book|author=Duffett, Judith |title=WLM vs. Miss America |work=Voice of the Women's Liberation Movement |date=October 1968 |page=4}}</ref> and accoutrements of what they perceived to be enforced [[femininity]].

{{As of|2016}}, the world's largest cosmetics company is [[L'Oréal]], founded by [[Eugène Schueller]] in 1909 as the French Harmless Hair Colouring Company (now owned by [[Liliane Bettencourt]] 26% and [[Nestlé]] 28%; the remaining 46% is traded publicly). Although modern makeup has been traditionally used mainly by women, an increasing number of men are using cosmetics usually associated with women to enhance or cover their own facial features such as blemishes and dark circles, as well the use of eyeshadow, mascara and lipstick by some. Cosmetics brands have increasingly also targeted men in the sale of cosmetics, with some products targeted [[Male cosmetics|specifically at men]].

==Types==
Though there are a large number of differing cosmetics used for a variety of different purposes, all cosmetics are typically intended to be applied externally. These products can be applied to the face (on the skin, lips, eyebrows and eyes), to the body (on the skin, in particular the hands and nails), and to the hair. These products may be intended for use as skincare, personal care or to alter the appearance, with the subset of cosmetics known as makeup primarily referring to products containing colour pigments intended for the purpose of altering the wearer's appearance; some manufacturers will distinguish only between "decorative" cosmetics intended to alter the appearance and "care" cosmetics designed for skincare and personal care.

Most cosmetics are also distinguished by the area of the body intended for application, with cosmetics designed to be used on the face and eye area usually applied with a brush, a makeup sponge, or the fingertips. Cosmetics can be also described by the physical composition of the product. Cosmetics can be liquid or cream [[emulsion]]s, powders (pressed or loose), dispersions, or [[anhydrous]] creams or sticks.

===Decorative===
* '''[[Primer (cosmetics)|Primers]]''' are used on the face before makeup is applied, creating a typically transparent, smooth layer over the top of the skin, allowing for makeup to be applied smoothly and evenly. Some primers may also be tinted, and this tint may match the wearer's skin tone, or may colour correct it, using greens, oranges and purples to even out the wearer's skin tone and correct redness, purple shadows or orange discolouration respectively.
* '''[[Concealer]]''' is a cream or liquid product used to conceal marks or blemishes of the skin. Concealer is typically the colour of the user's skin tone, and is generally applied after the face has been primed to even out the wearer's skin tone before foundation can be applied. Concealer is usually more heavily pigmented, higher coverage and thicker than foundation or tinted primers. Though concealer is often more heavy duty in terms of pigment and consistency than foundation, a number of different formulations intended for different styles of use - such as a lighter concealer for the eyes and a heavier concealer for stage makeup - are available, as well as colour correcting concealers intended to balance out discolouration of the skin specifically.
* '''[[Foundation (cosmetics)|Foundation]]''' is a cream, liquid, mousse or powder product applied to the entirety of the face to create a smooth and even base in the user's skin tone. Foundation provides a generally lower amount of coverage than concealer, and is sold in formulations that can provide sheer, matte, dewy or full coverage to the skin.<ref name=USHealthandHuman/>
* '''[[Rouge (cosmetics)|Rouge]]'''[[Rouge (cosmetics)|, '''blush''', or '''blusher''']] is a liquid, cream or powder product applied to the centre of the [[cheek]]s with the intention of adding or enhancing their natural colour. Blushers are typically available in shades of pink or warm tan and brown, and may also be used to make the [[Zygomatic bone|cheekbones]] appear more defined.<ref name=USHealthandHuman />
* '''[[Bronzer]]''' is a powder, cream or liquid product that adds colour to the skin, typically in bronze or tan shades intended to give the skin a tanned appearance and enhance the colour of the face. Bronzer, like highlighter, may also contain substances providing a shimmer or glitter effect,<ref name=USHealthandHuman /> and comes in either matte, semi-matte, satin, or shimmer finishes.
* '''[[Highlighter (cosmetics)|Highlighter]]''' is a liquid, cream or powder product applied to the high points of the face such as the eyebrows, nose and cheekbones. Highlighter commonly has substances added providing a shimmer or glitter effect. Alternatively, a lighter toned foundation or concealer can be used as a highlighter.
* '''[[Eyebrow]] pencils''', '''creams''', '''[[wax]]es''', '''gels''', and '''powders''' are used to color, fill in, and define the brows.<ref name=USHealthandHuman /><ref>{{Cite web|title=Eyebrow Pencil|url=https://cosmeticsinfo.org/products/eyebrow-pencil|url-status=live|access-date=2021-08-24|website=Cosmetics Info|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130806112505/https://cosmeticsinfo.org:80/products/eyebrow-pencil |archive-date=2013-08-06 }}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|last=Riordan|first=Teresa|date=2004-12-12|title='Inventing Beauty'|language=en-US|work=The New York Times|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2004/12/12/books/chapters/inventing-beauty.html|access-date=2021-08-24|issn=0362-4331|archive-date=2021-08-24|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210824233041/https://www.nytimes.com/2004/12/12/books/chapters/inventing-beauty.html|url-status=live}}</ref> Eyebrow tinting treatments are also used to dye the eyebrow hairs a darker colour, either temporarily or permanently, without staining and colouring the skin underneath the eyebrows.
* '''[[Eyeshadow]]''' is a powder, cream or liquid pigmented product used to draw attention to, accentuate and change the shape of the area around the eyes, on the eyelid and the space below the eyebrows. Eyeshadow is typically applied using an eyeshadow brush, with generally small and rounded bristles, though liquid and cream formulations may also be applied with the fingers. Eyeshadow is available in almost every colour, as well as being sold in a number of different finishes, ranging from matte finishes with sheer coverage to glossy, shimmery, glittery and highly pigmented finishes. Many different colours and finishes of eyeshadow may be combined in one look and blended together to achieve different effects.
* '''[[Eyeliner]]''' is used to enhance and elongate the apparent size or depth of the [[eye]]; though eyeliner is commonly black, it can come in many different colours, including brown, white and blue. Eyeliner can come in the form of a pencil, a gel or a liquid.
* '''[[Eyelash extensions|False eyelashes]]''' are used to extend, exaggerate and add volume to the eyelashes. Consisting generally of a small strip to which hair - either human, mink or synthetic - is attached, false eyelashes are typically applied to the lash line using glue, which can come in latex and latex free varieties; magnetic false eyelashes, which attach to the eyelid after magnetic eyeliner is applied, are also available. Designs vary in length and colour, with rhinestones, gems, feathers and lace available as false eyelash designs. False eyelashes are not permanent, and can be easily taken off with the fingers. Eyelash extensions are a more permanent way to achieve this look. Each set lasts for two to three weeks, then the set can be filled, similar to the maintenance of acrylic nails. To apply to extensions the certified lash artist would start by taping down the bottom eyelashes. The lash artist would then use two tweezers, one to isolate the natural eyelash and one to apply the false eyelash. An individual false eyelash, or lash fan, is applied to one natural eyelash using a lash glue specific for this process. The eyelashes should not be stuck together. The length and thickness of the false lash should not be to heavy for the natural eyelash. If this process is done correctly no harm will be done to the natural eyelashes.<ref>McDearmon, Christa. The Eyelash Extension Professional Training Manual: Instructor's Guide. Charleston, SC: CreateSpace Independent Publishing Platform, 2014. </ref>
* '''[[Mascara]]''' is used to darken, lengthen, thicken, or enhance the [[eyelash]]es through the use of a typically thick, cream consistency product applied with a spiral bristle mascara brush. Mascara is commonly black, brown or clear, though a number of different colours, some containing glitter, are available. Mascara is typically advertised and sold in a number of different formulations that advertise qualities such as [[waterproofing]], volume enhancement, length enhancement and curl enhancement, and may be used in combination with an [[eyelash curler]] to enhance the natural curl of the eyelashes.<ref name=USHealthandHuman />
